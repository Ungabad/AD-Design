    <p>The impact of having a website on a business's profitability can vary significantly based on several factors, including the industry, the quality of the website, and the effectiveness of its digital marketing strategies. However, there are some general statistics and findings that can offer insights:
<ol>
<li>Increased Visibility and Customer Reach: Businesses with websites can reach a broader audience. According to a study by the Small Business Administration, businesses with websites experience an average revenue increase of 39% compared to those without a web presence.</li>
<li>
Consumer Behavior: A report by the eCommerce Foundation found that 88% of consumers research products online before making a purchase. This indicates that having a website can significantly influence purchasing decisions and drive sales.</li>
<li>
E-commerce Growth: Businesses that sell products or services online (e-commerce) have seen substantial growth. For instance, Statista reports that global retail e-commerce sales amounted to $4.28 trillion in 2020 and are expected to grow to $6.39 trillion by 2024.</li>
<li>
Cost-Effective Marketing: A website can serve as a central hub for various digital marketing efforts, such as SEO, content marketing, and social media marketing. According to HubSpot, businesses that prioritize blogging efforts are 13 times more likely to see positive ROI.</li>
<li>
Customer Engagement and Retention: Websites can offer features like customer support, reviews, and personalized experiences, which can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. A study by Bain & Company found that increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%.</li>
<li>
Credibility and Professionalism: A survey by Verisign showed that 84% of consumers believe that small businesses with websites are more credible than those without.</li>
